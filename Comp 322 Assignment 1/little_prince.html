            I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.<br></p>

        <p>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that 
            I was carrying a very fragile treasure. <br><mark>It seemed to me, even, 
            that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.<br></mark></p>

        <p>In the moonlight, I looked at his pale forehead,
            his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled 
            in the wind,<br> and I said to myself:</p>
        <p class="highlight">
            "What I see here is nothing but a shell. 
            What is most important is invisible…”<br>
